SeaSTAR, an ARPA-e funded project, looked to adapt our NASA above-water joints to deepwater environments for use in deep-sea mining. Our fluid-filled joints are inherently pressure-balanced and require minor modifications for working underwater, only needing new seawater-rated proportional valves and material changes to reduce galvanic corrosion.
