Anchorbot was an Otherlab spinoff originally funded by the ARPA-e MARINER program. We developed a ROV to automate helical anchor installation, initially targeting 5-ton anchors for navigation buoys, marinas, and ocean instrumentation before scaling to 100-150 ton anchors for kelp farming and offshore wind. I was responsible for the structural design & electronic control systems for our prototype ROV, which successfully completed customer demonstrations in Alaska, California, and Maine.
