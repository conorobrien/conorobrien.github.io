Skyscrape produces a fabric that changes its insulation value with temperature, combining materials science, mechanical engineering, and textile engineering. Initially, I worked on a vision-controlled spinning machine to create coiled high-CTE fibers out of 100 um polyester monofilament. When those machines were producing yarn, I then transitioned to working on creating fabric thermal bimorphs alongside our textile experts. We debuted the technology during the Olympics opening ceremony as part of a [partnership with Ralph Lauren.](https://corporate.ralphlauren.com/pr_220120_BeijingOlympics.html)
