First prototyped in 2018, these are a novel type of textile-based soft gripper created on a Stoll ADF knitting machine. Using an intarsia of UHMWPE and elastic yarns with an inlaid nylon monofilament, we can create an anisotropic fabric structure that changes shape when inflated. They can conduct delicate picking tasks like a conformable silicone soft gripper. However, they can easily survive harsh environments and interact with sharp and pointy objects with little damage.
