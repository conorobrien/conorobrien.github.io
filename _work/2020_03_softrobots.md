First prototyped in 2018, these are a novel type of textile-based soft gripper created on a Stoll ADF knitting machine. Using an intarsia of UHMWPE and elastic yarns with an inlaid nylon monofilament, we can create an anisotropic fabric structure that changes shape when inflated. They can conduct delicate picking tasks like a traditional conformable silicone soft gripper. However, unlike silicone-based soft grippers, they can easily survive harsh environments and interact with sharp objects.
