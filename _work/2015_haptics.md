As a graduate student in the GRASP Lab at UPenn, I worked as a researcher in the Haptics Lab with Dr. Kuchenbecker. In an offshoot of an earlier haptics project, we worked to use machine learning to predict surgeon proficiency by instrumenting a Da Vinci Standard surgical robot during training tasks.
