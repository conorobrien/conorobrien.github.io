Designed for a NASA SBIR grant, this is a pneumatic continuum joint with textile actuators intended for high-impact tasks and delicate interactions. The final system has a reach of 1.2m, a max payload of 2kg, and a system mass of ~7.5kg. In testing, it successfully demonstrated a high-impact task by using a pneumatic air hammer to demolish bricks and rocks in a gravel bed. With a change of tooling, it also accomplished more delicate ground interaction tasks.
