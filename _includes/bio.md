Currently a senior engineer at Otherlab, working on all sorts of cutting-edge prototypes from isolation units to kelp farming tech. I've spent years diving deep into soft robotics, creating bendy joints and fabric-based actuators that work both above and underwater.

Before that, I helped develop shape-knit fabrics that change with temperature for adaptive clothing and designed parts for a 50kg tethered helicopter. I even figured out how to replace expensive laser equipment with a $20 USB camera!

I studied at UPenn, earning both my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and Master's in Robotics. While there, I created systems to automatically grade surgeons using machine learning.

My toolbox includes programming skills (Python, C++, ROS), design software (SolidWorks, Fusion 360), and hands-on prototyping from 3D printing to CNC machining. I'm equally comfortable with metalworking, electronics, and textile fabrication - including industrial knitting machines and sewing.

FAA-licensed drone pilot with a passion for mechatronics.
