                Working as internal consultant designing mechatronic prototypes
                for early-stage research projects including portable
                negative-pressure isolation units, battery-powered appliances,

        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mechanical design for single-DOF flexure-based continuum joints
                with textile actuators used both above and below water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed, prototyped, &amp; validated new type of shape-knit
                soft actuators, improving the manufacturing path, force output,
                reliability, and usable strain range compared to existing
                braided sleeve, cast rubber, or heat-welded actuators.
                <!-- - Improved existing pressure control systems using legacy valves and electronics control systems. -->
            </li>
            <li>
                Developed new pressure control system using COTS valves &amp;
                electronics and implemented a new software control system to
                replace legacy ROS software with python multi-threaded
                application to increase prototype iteration speed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Developed new system for estimating continuum joint state,
                replaced a constant curvature model with 5-segment constant
                curvature spline approximation. System is calibrated using
                Apriltag fiducials to fit a linear model of sensor values to
                segment curvature. Model coefficients are then used in a Kalman
                filter for estimating state using on-board sensors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Developed a new type of mixed-material intarsia knit soft
                gripper with reduced weight and increased strength, capable of
                lifting 8kg cardboard boxes with a six-fingered gripper massing
                ~500g.
