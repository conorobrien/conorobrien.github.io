id="anchorbot---cofounder-cto-january-2024---february-2025"><strong>Anchorbot</strong>
- <em>Cofounder &amp; CTO</em> January 2024 - February 2025</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Technical co-founder of Otherlab spinoff company developing an
ROV for marine anchor installation, managing project requirements,
schedules, and deliverables. Project produced a demonstration prototype
capable of installing small-scale (50 kN ultimate load) helical anchors
for early customers, and demonstrated scalability for eventual &gt;500
kN system.</p></li>
<li><p>Designed and fabricated instrumented ROV prototypes from concept
through testing, applying first principles analysis for structural
loads, buoyancy and control systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Simulated ROV using Gazebo &amp; Ardupilot SITL for testing new
control modes.</p></li>
<li><p>Developed comprehensive testing protocols and data acquisition
systems for ROV operations, demonstrating user needs and technical
goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Created live dashboards and data visualization tools for
monitoring system performance and communicating ROV capabilities to
potential customers and investors.</p></li>
<li><p>Managed logistics and execution for field demonstrations in
Alaska, Texas, and California, ensuring reliable ROV performance in
real-world and challenging field conditions.</p></li>

- <em>Senior Engineer</em> December 2021 - January 2024</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Acted as an internal consultant designing mechatronics systems
for research projects including medical devices, consumer appliances,
wearable orthotics and marine robotics, producing prototypes for
research experiments, demonstrations, and user testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Produced varied functional prototypes for early-stage concept
validation using a combination of CNC machining, additive manufacturing,
and soft-goods fabrication.</p></li>
<li><p>Mentored junior engineers and interns, helping them with
technical and process issues to produce prototypes.</p></li>

id="otherlab---soft-robots---project-co-lead-july-2020-december-2021"><strong>Otherlab
- Soft Robots</strong> - <em>Project Co-Lead</em> July 2020 – December
2021</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Mechanical lead for a project developing continuum joint-based
soft robotic arms capable of harsh-environment work for ARPA-E and NASA.
The project produced an arm prototype that demonstrated both high-impact
and delicate work while weighing less than 5 kg and potentially priced
as little as 1/10 an equivalent commercial robot arm.</p></li>
<li><p>Developed a novel continuum joint sensing system using Apriltag
fiducials to calibrate on-board sensors, implemented Kalman filtering
for real-time state estimation using on-board sensors only. This
replaced a constant-curvature joint model with a multi-segment spline
approximation to enable gravity compensation and more accurate end
effector positioning.</p></li>
<li><p>Designed and implemented a multi-threaded Python robot control
system, replaced legacy ROS-based software, improving prototype
iteration speed and reliability.</p></li>
<li><p>Created and experimentally validated shape-knit soft actuators
with improved manufacturing efficiency, force output, and reliability
compared to previous handmade, heat-welded actuators.</p></li>
<li><p>Designed experiments using computer vision, 6-axis force/torque
sensors, and statistical modeling to characterize actuator performance
and validate theoretical models.</p></li>
<li><p>Developed mixed-material intarsia knit grippers using Spectra
high-strength yarns, achieving high strength-to-weight ratios and
increased robustness compared to silicone soft grippers.</p></li>
</ul>

id="otherlab---skyscrape---senior-mechanical-engineer-july-2017-december-2019"><strong>Otherlab
- Skyscrape</strong> - <em>Senior Mechanical Engineer</em> July 2017 –
December 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Built prototypes for a project developing a variable-insulation
temperature-responsive fabric (i.e: a jacket or blanket that is always
comfortable, no matter the ambient temperature). Developed yarn-coiling
machines to produce high-CTE yarn and the knit version of a
thermal-bimorph fabric structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Replaced $18k laser micrometers with $20 computer vision system
using OpenCV and Raspberry Pi.</p></li>
<li><p>Designed vision-controlled twisting machines to coil 125-micron
filaments.</p></li>
<li><p>Developed theoretical models for fabric thermal bimorph
performance, validated models by developing automated fabric testing
equipment using depth cameras.</p></li>
<li><p>Learned industrial knitting and developed textile production
processes using Stoll ADF-530BW knitting machine and M1
software.</p></li>
